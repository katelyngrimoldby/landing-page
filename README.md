# landing-page
Flexbox landing page from TOP
# Project Description
Replicate provided mockup, utilizing flexbox where applicable with or without unique theming of colours, fonts, and images. Styleguide was provided for optional use. 

# Where I Went Beyond
I utilized semantic HTML to organize and label my content

I also added styling to hover states for all links, including call to action links - one of which I added to the navbar. 

# Where I May Have Lacked
I feel my code organization may have lacked in both my .scss and markup. 

# What I Plan on Doing Later
Reworking my code layout to be cleaner, and fixing any poor practice within my styling and/or html, when I become aware of any. 

I also want to make the page responsive when able to.
